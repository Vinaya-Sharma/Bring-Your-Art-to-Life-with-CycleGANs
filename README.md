# Bring-Your-Art-to-Life-with-CycleGANs

I hate to admit it, but I suck at art.

As a self-proclaimed artist, I’ve always dreamed of creating beautiful, breathtaking works of art. But sadly, stick figures and smiley faces seem to be the best that I can do.

After so many years, I refuse to let my lack of artistic ability hold me back. That’s why I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a GAN (generative adversarial network) to turn my nasty sketches into beautiful photographs. Using a combination of machine learning algorithms and a dataset of high-quality photographs, I built a GAN to transform my scribbles into realistic images that even Monet would be proud of.

In this project I will implement the CycleGAN to convert sketches into photographs to prove GANs can greatly improve the current creative design process. Whether you are an amateur like me who is looking to improve their art, or a seasoned professional that wants to save time, expiriment quick and increase efficiency, this build can help everyone.

You can find the original paper here, and an amazing CycleGAN implementation that this code is based off of here.
